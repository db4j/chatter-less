original process was something to the effect of:


- node ../../full/index.js 
- browse http://localhost:8008 and do a file upload and message
- json -s api -t src2 -T JSON -a GSON -P -E -S -l -p mm.rest -ds -dg -da


only the subset of api and src that actually got used in mmapi are committed here,
and they may be slightly different versions
